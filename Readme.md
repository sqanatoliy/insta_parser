# Follower Parser using Playwright

If you, like me, want to have a convenient table listing your followers, try using a script like mine. 
With the Playwright library, you can easily fetch the list of followers and save it in CSV format for effortless viewing.

## How to Use


* Install Dependencies:

```
pip install playwright
```


* ### Run the Script:

```python insta_parser.py```


* ### Get Your List of Followers:

The script utilizes Playwright to retrieve the list of followers from the chosen platform 
and saves it in a file named `followers.csv` .


* ### View in a Convenient Format:

Open `followers.csv` using a spreadsheet editor to comfortably view and analyze your followers.


Enjoy using our script! If you have any questions or encounter issues, please create an issue in the repository.
